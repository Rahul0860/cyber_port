## CTF Lab Adventures & Reports üö©

I actively engage in Capture The Flag (CTF) labs on platforms like Hack The Box to continuously hone my practical cybersecurity skills. This hands-on experience allows me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing my abilities in areas such as:

* **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Identifying and leveraging weaknesses in systems.
* **Web Security:** Understanding and mitigating web application vulnerabilities.
* **Cryptography:** Breaking and implementing encryption techniques.
* **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing software to understand its functionality and potential flaws.
* **Digital Forensics:** Investigating security incidents and analyzing digital evidence.

For several CTF labs, I create detailed PDF reports documenting my step-by-step process of solving the challenges. These reports showcase my methodology, the tools I used, and my understanding of the underlying vulnerabilities. You can find examples of these reports in the links below:
